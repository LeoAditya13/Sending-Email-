# Sending Motivational Quotes via Email
This Python script sends a motivational quote via email to a specified recipient using the SMTP protocol. It uses a text file containing motivational quotes as a source.

# Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x installed on your system
2. Access to an SMTP server (e.g., Gmail) to send emails

# Notes
Ensure your SMTP server allows you to send emails programmatically. For Gmail, you may need to enable "less secure app access" or use an app password if two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled.
Handle exceptions and errors gracefully, especially when dealing with sensitive information like email credentials.

# Troubleshooting
If emails are not being sent, check:
Your internet connection and SMTP server settings.
Correctness of email addresses and credentials.
Any error messages printed by the script.

# Security Considerations
Avoid hardcoding sensitive information (like passwords) directly in the script. Use environment variables or secure storage methods where possible.
Regularly update and review the script for security vulnerabilities.
